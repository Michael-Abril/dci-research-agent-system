  "title": "The GENIUS Act is Now Law. What's Missing?",
  "description": "This MIT DCI analysis examines the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act after its passage into law, identifying critical gaps in the legislation. While the GENIUS Act establishes a federal framework for stablecoin regulation — including reserve requirements, issuer registration, and redemption rights — the paper argues that several important areas remain unaddressed or insufficiently specified. Key gaps include: inadequate treatment of algorithmic stablecoins, lack of DeFi interaction rules, insufficient cross-border coordination mechanisms, weak operational resilience requirements for blockchain infrastructure, and ambiguity about the relationship between stablecoin regulation and existing banking law. The paper provides specific recommendations for regulatory implementation that could address these gaps through rulemaking rather than additional legislation.",

      "title": "What the GENIUS Act Gets Right",
      "summary": "Acknowledges the positive elements of the legislation: establishing a federal regulatory framework rather than a patchwork of state laws, requiring 1:1 reserve backing in approved asset classes, mandating monthly reserve attestations by registered public accounting firms, providing holders with a legal right to timely redemption at par, requiring issuers to register with the OCC (for bank issuers) or state regulators (for non-bank issuers) with minimum capital requirements, and establishing basic AML/CFT obligations. The paper recognizes these as necessary foundations but argues they are insufficient for the unique risks stablecoins present.",

      "end_page": 4,
      "content": "The GENIUS Act establishes important regulatory foundations: (1) Federal framework — creates uniform federal requirements for stablecoin issuers, preempting the current patchwork of state money transmitter licenses. Issuers of stablecoins with >$10B market cap must register federally. (2) Reserve requirements — mandates 1:1 backing in approved asset classes: US Treasuries (<93 days maturity), central bank reserves, fully collateralized repurchase agreements, and insured bank deposits. Prohibits risky or opaque reserve compositions. (3) Attestation requirements — monthly attestations by registered public accounting firms, with annual financial statement audits. Makes reserve composition publicly available. (4) Redemption rights — legal obligation to redeem at par in US dollars within a 'reasonable timeframe' (to be specified by rulemaking). (5) Issuer qualification — minimum capital requirements, fit-and-proper management standards, and AML/BSA obligations. (6) Interoperability with banking — bank-issued stablecoins regulated by existing banking regulators; non-bank issuers regulated by state regulators with federal floor standards. These provisions address the most basic stablecoin risks — reserve adequacy, transparency, and consumer redemption rights — but the legislation leaves significant gaps.",

      "title": "Gap 1: Algorithmic and Crypto-Backed Stablecoins",
      "summary": "Identifies insufficient treatment of algorithmic stablecoins (like the failed TerraUSD/Luna) and crypto-collateralized stablecoins (like DAI/MakerDAO). The GENIUS Act's reserve requirements effectively prohibit unbacked algorithmic stablecoins but are ambiguous about stablecoins backed by cryptocurrency collateral with over-collateralization ratios. The TerraUSD collapse destroyed $40 billion in value; the paper argues the legislation should explicitly define and either prohibit or regulate algorithmic mechanisms rather than leaving enforcement to interpretation.",
      "start_page": 4,
      "end_page": 7,
      "content": "The GENIUS Act's approved reserve asset list (Treasuries, bank deposits, repos) effectively prohibits purely algorithmic stablecoins that rely on mint/burn mechanisms without backing. However, ambiguities remain: (1) Crypto-collateralized stablecoins — systems like MakerDAO's DAI use over-collateralized cryptocurrency (e.g., $150 of ETH backing $100 of DAI) with automated liquidation. These don't fit neatly into the approved asset framework but aren't explicitly addressed. Are they prohibited? Regulated differently? (2) Hybrid models — some stablecoins use partial reserves plus algorithmic mechanisms. The Act doesn't address fractional or hybrid approaches clearly. (3) Definition scope — the Act defines 'payment stablecoin' as a digital asset designed for use as a means of payment pegged to a fixed value. This may exclude some stablecoin-like instruments (yield-bearing tokens, wrapped bank deposits) that function similarly but have different legal characterizations. (4) Enforcement mechanism — while the reserve requirements effectively bar algorithmic stablecoins, there's no explicit prohibition or definition. Future novel designs might exploit definitional ambiguity. Recommendation: Regulators should issue explicit guidance on (a) the definition of prohibited algorithmic mechanisms, (b) the treatment of over-collateralized crypto-backed stablecoins, and (c) the regulatory status of hybrid reserve models.",

      "title": "Gap 2: DeFi Integration and Smart Contract Risks",
      "summary": "Highlights the absence of provisions addressing stablecoins' role in decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins are the primary medium of exchange in DeFi protocols — used for lending (Aave, Compound), derivatives (Synthetix), automated market making (Uniswap), and yield strategies. The GENIUS Act treats stablecoins as payment instruments but doesn't address: (1) whether issuers are responsible for stablecoin use in DeFi, (2) smart contract risk (bugs, exploits, governance attacks) that can cause stablecoin losses, (3) MEV (maximal extractable value) that can extract value from stablecoin transactions, and (4) the systemic risk of stablecoin de-pegging cascading through interconnected DeFi protocols.",
      "start_page": 7,
      "end_page": 10,
      "content": "The GENIUS Act ignores DeFi's central role in stablecoin usage. By volume, the majority of stablecoin transactions occur within DeFi protocols, not traditional payments. Unaddressed issues: (1) Issuer responsibility for DeFi use — when USDC is deposited into a lending protocol that gets exploited, is Circle responsible? The Act is silent. This creates moral hazard: issuers benefit from DeFi usage (float, adoption) without bearing the risks. (2) Smart contract risk — DeFi protocols are code, and code has bugs. Over $3 billion has been lost to DeFi exploits since 2020. Stablecoin holders who deposit into DeFi face smart contract risk that is not covered by any insurance or regulatory protection. (3) Systemic interconnection — stablecoins are collateral across hundreds of DeFi protocols. A major stablecoin de-peg would cascade through the entire DeFi ecosystem. The Act doesn't address this systemic risk or require issuers to monitor/limit DeFi exposure. (4) Blacklist/freeze capabilities — most major stablecoins (USDC, USDT) have admin functions to freeze addresses. The Act doesn't specify when issuers must or may exercise these powers in DeFi contexts. (5) MEV — blockchain transaction ordering can be manipulated to extract value from stablecoin transactions (front-running, sandwich attacks). No consumer protection addresses this. Recommendation: Rulemaking should address issuer obligations regarding DeFi integration, smart contract audit requirements, and systemic risk monitoring frameworks.",

      "title": "Gap 3: Cross-Border Coordination and Sanctions",
      "summary": "Notes the lack of international coordination mechanisms despite stablecoins' inherently global nature. A US-issued stablecoin circulates on public blockchains worldwide without geographic restrictions. The GENIUS Act's jurisdiction is limited to US issuers, creating regulatory arbitrage opportunities. Foreign-issued stablecoins (Tether/USDT, issued by a BVI entity) may continue operating in US markets under different rules. OFAC sanctions compliance for permissionless transfers is practically unenforceable at the protocol level, creating tension between regulatory requirements and technical reality.",
      "start_page": 10,
      "end_page": 13,
      "content": "Stablecoins are inherently global, but the GENIUS Act is jurisdictionally limited: (1) Regulatory arbitrage — the Act applies to US-based issuers. Foreign issuers (like Tether, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands) serve US users without meeting GENIUS Act requirements. Without international coordination, strict US regulation may simply push issuance offshore while US users continue using foreign stablecoins. (2) Sanctions enforcement — OFAC sanctions require blocking transactions with sanctioned addresses. On permissionless blockchains, this is technically challenging: smart contracts can't check sanctions lists, and pseudonymous addresses make identification difficult. The Act doesn't address how issuers should implement sanctions compliance for permissionless transfers. (3) Cross-border payments — stablecoins enable instant, low-cost international transfers that bypass traditional correspondent banking. This has remittance benefits but also money laundering risks. The Act doesn't coordinate with international frameworks (FATF Travel Rule) for stablecoin transfers. (4) Reserve asset jurisdiction — if a US stablecoin issuer holds reserves in multiple jurisdictions for operational reasons, which regulator supervises the reserves? The Act doesn't address multi-jurisdictional reserve management. Recommendation: The US should lead international coordination through the FSB (Financial Stability Board) and FATF to establish global minimum standards for stablecoin regulation, similar to the Basel standards for banking.",

      "title": "Gap 4: Operational Resilience and Technology Standards",
      "summary": "Identifies weak operational requirements for blockchain infrastructure. The GENIUS Act mandates 'adequate' risk management but doesn't specify technology standards for smart contract security, key management, upgrade governance, or blockchain selection. Unlike banking regulation (which specifies technology examination procedures, business continuity requirements, and third-party risk management), the Act leaves blockchain-specific operational risks largely unaddressed. The paper recommends specific technical standards for smart contract audits, multisig/MPC key management, incident response, and disaster recovery.",
      "start_page": 13,
      "end_page": 15,
      "content": "The GENIUS Act's operational resilience requirements are insufficiently specific for blockchain-based systems: (1) Smart contract security — no requirement for formal verification, security audits, or bug bounty programs for stablecoin smart contracts. Banking regulators have detailed IT examination procedures; stablecoin regulators need equivalent blockchain-specific standards. (2) Key management — stablecoin admin keys (minting, burning, freezing, upgrading) represent extreme concentration of power. The Act doesn't specify key management requirements: multisig thresholds, HSM usage, key ceremony procedures, or separation of duties. (3) Upgrade governance — many stablecoin contracts are upgradeable via proxy patterns. An upgrade can change the contract's behavior arbitrarily. The Act doesn't address upgrade governance, timelock requirements, or holder notification. (4) Blockchain selection — stablecoins operate on multiple blockchains with different security properties. The Act doesn't address minimum blockchain security requirements or how multi-chain deployment affects reserve management. (5) Incident response — no requirements for incident response plans, responsible disclosure procedures for smart contract vulnerabilities, or communication protocols for de-peg events. Recommendation: Regulators should issue technology-specific guidance comparable to banking IT examination standards, adapted for blockchain and smart contract infrastructure.",
