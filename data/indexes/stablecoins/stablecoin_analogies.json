  "title": "Stablecoins and the Limits of Existing Analogies",
  "description": "This MIT DCI working paper critically examines the common analogies used to describe and regulate stablecoins — money market funds, bank deposits, prepaid access, and e-money — and argues that none of these analogies fully captures the unique characteristics of stablecoins. Stablecoins combine elements from multiple financial instruments in novel ways: they are bearer instruments like cash, backed by reserves like money market funds, issued by non-bank entities like e-money, and operate on permissionless blockchain infrastructure unlike any traditional financial product. The paper demonstrates that regulatory frameworks built on any single analogy will have critical blind spots, and proposes that stablecoin regulation needs a purpose-built framework that addresses the unique risks of programmable, globally transferable, bearer digital assets backed by pooled reserves.",

      "title": "The Money Market Fund Analogy",
      "summary": "Examines the comparison between stablecoins and money market funds (MMFs). Both pool investor funds into safe assets (Treasuries, commercial paper) and aim to maintain a stable $1 NAV. However, the analogy breaks down in critical ways: MMFs are regulated under the Investment Company Act with SEC oversight; stablecoin reserves are opaque and unaudited. MMF shares are redeemed through regulated broker-dealers; stablecoin transfers are permissionless and irreversible. MMFs experienced 'breaking the buck' in 2008, leading to reforms (floating NAV, gates/fees); stablecoins have experienced similar de-pegging events (TerraUSD collapse) without comparable regulatory response. Most importantly, MMF shares don't circulate as payment instruments — stablecoins do.",

      "content": "The money market fund analogy captures reserve management similarities but misses payment system properties. Similarities: Both stablecoins and MMFs pool funds into short-term, high-quality assets aiming for stable $1 value. Both face redemption risk if underlying assets lose value or liquidity. Both use 'breaking the buck' terminology when value drops below $1. Differences that matter: (1) MMFs are regulated investment vehicles under the Investment Company Act of 1940; stablecoin issuers face no comparable uniform federal regulation. (2) MMF shares cannot be transferred peer-to-peer — they are redeemed through the fund. Stablecoins circulate freely on blockchain networks, creating secondary market dynamics absent from MMFs. (3) MMF redemptions are processed by regulated intermediaries with AML/KYC requirements. Stablecoin transfers can be permissionless and pseudonymous. (4) MMFs disclose portfolio holdings regularly; stablecoin reserve composition and attestation practices vary dramatically across issuers. (5) Post-2008 MMF reforms (SEC Rule 2a-7 amendments) introduced floating NAV, gates, and liquidity fees for institutional funds. No comparable requirements exist for stablecoins. The TerraUSD/Luna collapse ($40B value destruction) demonstrated that stablecoin 'reserves' can be fundamentally different from what investors assume.",

      "title": "The Bank Deposit Analogy",
      "summary": "Analyzes the comparison with bank deposits. Both serve as stores of value denominated in national currency, and both can be used for payments. However, bank deposits are protected by FDIC insurance, created through fractional reserve lending, and subject to comprehensive prudential regulation (capital requirements, liquidity ratios, stress testing). Stablecoins are not insured, are ostensibly fully backed (not fractional), and operate outside the banking regulatory perimeter. The 'narrow bank' sub-analogy is explored — stablecoins resemble a narrow bank that holds only safe assets and does no lending — but even this comparison fails because narrow banks would still face bank regulation, examination, and resolution procedures.",
      "start_page": 5,
      "end_page": 8,
      "content": "Bank deposits share payment functionality with stablecoins but differ fundamentally in structure: Similarities: Both denominated in national currency, used for payments, and represent claims on an issuer backed by assets. Users expect immediate par redemption. Differences: (1) FDIC insurance — bank deposits are insured up to $250,000, providing a government backstop that prevents retail bank runs. Stablecoins have no comparable insurance; holder losses in issuer failure are unrecoverable. (2) Fractional reserve — banks lend out most deposits, creating money through credit. Stablecoins claim full reserve backing (1:1), though verification is limited. If stablecoins did engage in fractional lending, they'd be unregulated banks. (3) Prudential regulation — banks face capital requirements, liquidity ratios, stress tests, living wills, and regular examination. Stablecoin issuers face none of these. (4) Lender of last resort — banks can borrow from the Fed's discount window in liquidity crises. Stablecoin issuers cannot. (5) Resolution — FDIC has orderly resolution authority for failed banks. No comparable mechanism exists for stablecoin issuers. The 'narrow bank' comparison is the closest analogy: a stablecoin issuer resembles a bank that holds only Treasury securities and doesn't lend. But even narrow banks (like TNB USA, which the Fed refused to grant a master account) face full banking regulation. Stablecoins obtain the benefits of deposit-like functionality without any of the regulatory obligations that make deposits safe.",

      "title": "The E-Money and Prepaid Access Analogies",
      "summary": "Evaluates comparisons with electronic money (as defined in EU regulations) and US prepaid access products. E-money regulations require issuers to safeguard customer funds, maintain 1:1 reserves in liquid assets, and submit to regulatory supervision — closer to stablecoins than banking regulation but still not a perfect fit. US prepaid access (FinCEN) focuses primarily on AML/BSA compliance rather than prudential safety. Both analogies miss the unique properties of blockchain-based assets: permissionless transferability, global reach without licensing in each jurisdiction, programmability through smart contracts, and composability with DeFi protocols.",
      "start_page": 8,
      "end_page": 11,
      "content": "E-money and prepaid access offer the closest existing regulatory analogies but still fall short. EU E-Money Directive (EMD2): Requires e-money issuers to safeguard funds in segregated accounts, maintain 1:1 liquid asset backing, and register with national regulators. This is structurally similar to ideal stablecoin regulation. However: (1) EMD2 assumes issuers control the payment network — they can freeze, reverse, or restrict transfers. Blockchain-based stablecoins may not have these capabilities (or may have them selectively via blocklist contracts). (2) EMD2 doesn't address smart contract risk, composability with DeFi, or MEV (miner extractable value). (3) EMD2 assumes jurisdiction-specific licensing. Stablecoins operate globally without geographic boundaries. US Prepaid Access (FinCEN): Focuses on anti-money-laundering (BSA compliance, suspicious activity reporting) rather than consumer protection or prudential safety. Prepaid access providers must register as MSBs and maintain AML programs, but have no capital or reserve requirements. Critical properties unique to stablecoins that no existing analogy addresses: (1) Permissionless transfer — no gatekeeper required to send/receive. (2) Programmability — stablecoins can be embedded in smart contracts for lending, derivatives, and automated strategies. (3) Composability — stablecoins interact with hundreds of DeFi protocols, creating interconnected risk. (4) Atomic settlement — blockchain settlement is immediate and irreversible, unlike traditional payment systems with settlement delays and dispute resolution.",

      "title": "Toward a Purpose-Built Regulatory Framework",
      "summary": "Argues that stablecoin regulation needs a bespoke framework rather than forcing stablecoins into existing categories. The paper proposes key elements: mandatory reserve requirements with regular independent audits, real-time or near-real-time reserve attestation using cryptographic proofs (proof of reserves), redemption rights with guaranteed timeframes, operational resilience requirements for blockchain infrastructure, governance and wind-down procedures, and explicit treatment of the issuer-holder relationship as a new category of financial obligation. The framework should be principles-based to accommodate innovation while establishing clear floors for consumer protection.",
      "start_page": 11,
      "end_page": 14,
      "content": "Stablecoins need purpose-built regulation because existing analogies create dangerous blind spots. Proposed framework elements: (1) Reserve requirements — mandatory 1:1 backing in high-quality liquid assets (Treasuries, central bank reserves), with clear prohibitions on risky assets and self-referential backing (no algorithmic stablecoins claiming to be 'backed'). (2) Transparency — regular independent audits (not just attestations) of reserve composition, plus exploration of cryptographic proof-of-reserves that can be verified on-chain. (3) Redemption rights — holders must have a legal right to redeem at par within a specified timeframe (e.g., 1 business day for retail, T+0 for wholesale), enforceable regardless of the stablecoin's market price. (4) Operational resilience — requirements for smart contract security audits, incident response plans, key management, and upgrade governance. (5) Wind-down planning — issuers must maintain wind-down plans that ensure orderly redemption of all outstanding stablecoins if the issuer ceases operations. (6) Interoperability standards — requirements for cross-chain and cross-stablecoin compatibility to prevent monopolistic lock-in. (7) DeFi interaction rules — clear guidance on issuer responsibility when stablecoins are used in DeFi protocols (lending, derivatives) and whether issuers can/should restrict certain uses. The paper argues this framework should be federal (not state-by-state), principles-based (to accommodate technological evolution), and coordinated internationally (given stablecoins' global nature).",
