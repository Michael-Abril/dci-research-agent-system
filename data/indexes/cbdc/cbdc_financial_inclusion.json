  "title": "CBDC: Expanding Financial Inclusion or Deepening the Divide?",
  "description": "This paper by MIT DCI and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston examines whether a US Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would advance financial inclusion or potentially widen existing disparities. It analyzes the barriers that currently exclude approximately 5.9 million US households from the banking system — including cost, trust, documentation requirements, and geographic access — and evaluates whether a CBDC could address these barriers or create new ones. The paper draws on interviews with underbanked communities, analysis of existing digital payment adoption patterns, and comparisons with international CBDC pilots. Key findings suggest that while a CBDC could reduce certain barriers (transaction costs, geographic access), it could deepen others (digital literacy requirements, privacy concerns in marginalized communities, smartphone dependency) unless explicitly designed with inclusion as a primary objective rather than an afterthought.",

      "title": "Current State of Financial Exclusion in the US",
      "summary": "Analyzes the demographics and causes of financial exclusion. Approximately 5.9 million US households (4.5%) are unbanked, with significantly higher rates among Black (11.3%), Hispanic (9.3%), and Native American households. Primary barriers include minimum balance requirements, unpredictable fees, lack of government-issued ID, distrust of financial institutions (especially in communities with histories of predatory lending), and geographic distance from bank branches. The paper argues that these barriers are not primarily technological — they are economic, social, and institutional — and that a CBDC must address root causes rather than assuming digital access automatically equals financial access.",

      "content": "Financial exclusion in the US affects 5.9 million households (4.5% of all US households, per 2021 FDIC survey). Rates are dramatically higher in marginalized communities: Black households (11.3%), Hispanic (9.3%), American Indian/Alaska Native (16.9%), households with disabilities (14.8%), and households earning below $15,000/year (17.2%). Primary barriers to banking: (1) Cost — minimum balance requirements, overdraft fees, and monthly maintenance fees disproportionately burden low-income households. A single overdraft fee ($35) can exceed a day's wages. (2) Trust — communities with histories of discriminatory lending (redlining, payday lending concentration) have rational distrust of financial institutions. (3) Documentation — requirements for government-issued photo ID, proof of address, and SSN exclude undocumented immigrants, homeless individuals, and those lacking standard documentation. (4) Geographic access — bank branch closures have accelerated in rural and low-income urban areas, creating 'banking deserts'. (5) Digital access — 15% of US adults do not use smartphones; rates are higher among elderly and low-income populations. These barriers are structural, not merely technological. A CBDC that ignores these root causes risks digital exclusion layered on top of existing financial exclusion.",

      "title": "CBDC Design Choices That Affect Inclusion",
      "summary": "Examines specific CBDC design decisions and their inclusion implications. Account-based vs. token-based models have different identity requirements. Intermediated vs. direct models affect who controls access. Online-only vs. offline-capable designs determine whether the CBDC works without internet connectivity. Interest-bearing vs. non-interest-bearing designs affect savings incentives. The paper maps each design choice to its impact on the specific inclusion barriers identified in the previous section, creating a decision framework for CBDC designers who prioritize inclusion.",
      "start_page": 5,
      "end_page": 9,
      "content": "CBDC design choices have direct inclusion consequences: (1) Identity model — account-based CBDCs require identity verification, potentially excluding the same populations excluded from banking. Token-based (bearer instrument) CBDCs could enable anonymous small-value transactions, reducing documentation barriers, but raise AML concerns. A tiered approach (limited anonymous access for small amounts, full KYC for larger amounts) balances inclusion with compliance. (2) Distribution model — direct central bank accounts could bypass discriminatory intermediaries but would require the Fed to handle customer service for 330M people. Intermediated models leverage existing infrastructure but perpetuate the gatekeeper dynamics that cause exclusion. (3) Connectivity — online-only CBDCs exclude the 21 million Americans without broadband. Offline capability (using secure hardware for local transactions) is critical for rural and low-income communities. (4) Device requirements — smartphone-only designs exclude 15% of adults. The CBDC should support feature phones, physical cards, or other low-cost access methods. (5) Fee structure — zero-fee basic transactions remove the cost barrier that is the #1 reason cited for being unbanked. (6) Interest — paying interest on CBDC holdings could incentivize savings among unbanked populations but could also destabilize commercial bank deposits.",

      "title": "Risks of Deepening the Digital Divide",
      "summary": "Identifies ways a poorly designed CBDC could worsen financial exclusion. If cash is deprecated in favor of CBDC, populations without digital access lose their primary payment method. Privacy concerns are acute in communities already subject to government surveillance. Cybersecurity risks disproportionately affect populations with lower digital literacy. Algorithmic bias in intermediary systems could replicate or amplify existing discrimination. The paper argues that a CBDC without explicit inclusion mandates will default to serving already-included populations, as market incentives don't naturally serve low-margin customers.",
      "start_page": 9,
      "end_page": 12,
      "content": "A CBDC poses several inclusion risks: (1) Cash displacement — if CBDC adoption leads merchants to stop accepting cash, the 5.9 million unbanked households lose their primary payment method. The paper argues CBDC must complement cash, not replace it, for at least a generation. (2) Privacy in marginalized communities — communities with experiences of government surveillance (immigrant communities, communities targeted by law enforcement) may refuse to use a government-issued digital payment system. Privacy is not a luxury — it is essential for trust. (3) Digital literacy gap — elderly, disabled, and low-education populations face higher barriers to adopting digital payments. Error rates, scam vulnerability, and inability to recover from mistakes are all higher. (4) Cybersecurity inequality — low-income users are more likely to use shared devices, public WiFi, and less secure phones, making them more vulnerable to theft and fraud. (5) Intermediary discrimination — if banks and fintechs control CBDC access, they may apply the same discriminatory practices (de-risking entire communities, closing accounts without explanation) that cause current exclusion. (6) Infrastructure inequality — the digital divide maps closely to the financial exclusion divide. Without simultaneous investment in broadband, devices, and digital literacy, CBDC benefits accrue primarily to already-connected populations.",

      "title": "Recommendations and International Lessons",
      "summary": "Proposes design principles for an inclusive CBDC based on international pilot experiences and community engagement. Draws lessons from Nigeria's eNaira (low adoption due to trust issues), the Bahamas' Sand Dollar (offline capability important for island communities), and China's e-CNY (tiered identity model). Recommends: mandatory offline capability, tiered KYC, zero-fee basic transactions, legal tender status for cash alongside CBDC, community-based intermediary models, and ongoing inclusion impact assessment. Emphasizes that inclusion must be designed in from the beginning, not retrofitted.",
      "start_page": 12,
      "end_page": 15,
      "content": "Recommendations for inclusive CBDC design: (1) Maintain cash — legal tender status for physical currency must be preserved alongside CBDC. Forcing digital-only payments is exclusionary. (2) Tiered identity — small-value CBDC wallets (e.g., <$500 balance, <$1,000/month transactions) should be available with minimal identity requirements. Higher tiers require standard KYC. This follows the Sand Dollar and e-CNY models. (3) Offline capability — the CBDC must work without internet connectivity using secure hardware elements for local peer-to-peer transactions. (4) Zero-fee basics — basic CBDC transactions should be free to users, removing the #1 barrier to financial participation. (5) Multi-device access — support smartphones, feature phones, physical cards, and potentially biometric authentication to minimize device requirements. (6) Community intermediaries — authorize community organizations, libraries, and post offices as CBDC access points, not just banks and fintechs. (7) Anti-discrimination requirements — intermediaries must demonstrate equitable service provision as a condition of authorization. (8) Impact assessment — ongoing measurement of CBDC adoption rates across demographic groups, with corrective action if disparities emerge. International lessons: Nigeria's eNaira achieved <0.5% adoption partly due to trust deficits with government digital systems; the Bahamas' Sand Dollar demonstrated that offline capability is essential for underserved areas; China's e-CNY tiered wallet system shows that reducing identity requirements increases adoption among previously excluded populations.",
